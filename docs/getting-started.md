# Getting Started with DSA Mastery

## Repository Structure

- `leetcode/`: LeetCode problems organized by number, pattern, and difficulty
- `notes/`: Interactive MDX notes on concepts and patterns
- `dsa/`: Core data structure and algorithm implementations
- `visualizer/`: Algorithm visualization tools
- `playground/`: Experimentation and debugging exercises
- `tools/`: Helper scripts and utilities
- `docs/`: Documentation and guides

## Setup

1. Install dependencies (if using visualizer):

   ```bash
   cd visualizer
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the visualizer:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Daily Practice Routine

1. Review one concept from notes
2. Solve 2-3 LeetCode problems
3. Debug one complex solution
4. Implement one data structure/algorithm
