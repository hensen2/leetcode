88 - Merge Sorted Array [Easy]
Two Pointers | Array
Time: O(m+n) | Space: O(1)

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, 
representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. 
To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, 
and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
